# What the f*** is this?

This is a useless (**yet essential**) tiny program that makes the computer speak dialogs. It uses different voices to act different persons. By default, the first person is a female, and the second is a male.

## How to use it?

Just `wget` or `curl` the script and run it with a filename as argument.

For lazy people, here is the script you can download. :wink:

## Dependencies

For now, it only works with Mac OS X because it uses `say`.

 - `say`
